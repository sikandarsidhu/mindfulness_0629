Thank you for purchasing this asset!

To place the animal into your scene, simply drag and drop the animal from the Prefabs folder. The
animal is ready to go when placed in the scene. The WanderScript, attached to each prefab,
is documented for your preview and/or editability.

The WanderScript is made to have your animal(s) wander in a general location. You can edit properties of the script
in the Editor. 

The MaxDistance variable will limit the distance the animal can wander away from its starting position. You can also
set the minimum and maximum walking and idle times, per animal. This will limit how long the animal will walk until
resting idle, and how long the animal will stand idle, until walking again.

Weather the animal stands idle, or begins walking on start is chosen randomly in the script, on lines 64-70.

If you do not wish for the animal to wander at all, simply uncheck the Wander variable, in the Editor.
The animal will instead loop the animation currently in the clip of the Animation Component. An idle
animation is already pre-load in the animal prefab.

If, instead, you do not want the animal to ever stop walking, set the IdleAnimations size to 0, in the Editor. The
IdleAnimations variable is an array of idle animations to be played at random, when the animal is at rest. If left
empty, the animal will never stand idle.
